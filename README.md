//walkthrough for project development and proposal

neurons : 
number starts with 28 x 28 grid of pixels, in the program
each grid is neuron (784 neuurons here )

each neuron holds anumber , that starts from 0(black pixel) to 1(white pixel)
this number is called activation


784 neuron ko first layer huncha
last layer ma 10 ota neuron matra huncha
first ra last ko bichma, couple of neurons layer haru huncha (hidden layers)

activation in this neuron (last neuron layer ma) , represents how much the system thinks it is the given number

last neuron layer ma, 10 ota neuron huncha, 0 to 9, manam , eti mero, 5 ko activation is 0.8 (which is highest among all other 9 neuron) , then the system will tell that the written number represents 5


in our project, we will use two neuron layers with 16 neurons in each
